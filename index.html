                            <p>I am one of the top <strong>25,000</strong> users of Github.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>In 3 short years, I have amassed a ton of knowledge on web development and programming. I thrive on challenges and have embraced a learn-by-doing approach. I purposely try different techniques versus always sticking with the tried and true. It is becoming a rare occurrence where I get totally stumped or get to an impasse that I cannot salvage.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>This past year, I have been focusing on accessibility, testing, and full-stack applications.  Change is constant. I am not afraid to pivot and move on from the technologies I have learned. I have a strong foundation and I know I can learn whatever comes next. I am currently learning Angular, Java and Spring Boot.</p>
