                        <h2>About me</h2>
                        <p class="description">I have seriously studied computer programming and web development for the last 3 years. I had some programming experience prior to that, and I must say, programming has never been easier to learn and practice. I enjoy coding challenges, and I am constantly looking to improve. I completed all of FreeCodeCamp's curriculum about 2 years ago. I have completed most of the NodeSchool challenges and found many to be valuable, even if they are out of date. I have completed all the free Frontend Mentor challenges. I have completed two-thirds of Devchallenges' curriculum. I have completed three-fourths of the Odin Project's javascript curriculum. I did most of the learning labs on Github. I have completed a good percentage of Codecademy courses. I have completed various Google Codelabs. I have completed many MakeSchool tutorials. I have tried many frameworks and various programming languages. Change is constant in web development, and it is important to keep up to date on changes. I regularly read development blogs and I am subscribed to various newsletters to stay current. This past year, I have been focusing on accessibility, testing, and full-stack applications. In the future, I plan to learn more about Redux Toolkit, .NET, Remix, and Angular. I have not used Vue nor focused much on mobile development. Below is a selection of my many repos from Github.
